A class in C++ has 2 main characteristics:
1. It can accept variables, functions, 
2. It can countain access specifiers:
	a) Private: Accessible only from within members of the same class 
	b) Public:	Members are accessible from anywhere where the object is visible.
	c) Protected: Accessible from within members of the same class and also derived members 
		of their class 

3. If there is no access specifier identified the default access of a variables is Private
